Overall I performed quite well in this lab with some minor setbacks. Creating a repository was pretty simple, simply following the instructions as provided in the assignment yielded correct results. Creating a GitHub account was simple.

My first issue arose when setting up Git on the Command Line. When creating the config file I accidently mispelled it as vonfig, leading to much confusion later on when I was unable to comect ./dotifles to my repository on GitHub. But I was able to discover this mistake by simply retracing my steps.

Setup four was not difficult in itself but I did make the mistake of not adding the commands to the hw text file, leading to some difficulty later on when trying to retrieve my earlier commands.
